   		  			<span class="lead">F</span>lagstone is a property company tailor-made to the needs of every client interested in buying selling and renting property be it land for homes, factories, warehouses, schools, business offices, development; or already developed properties for rent or lease for any purpose. At Flagstone we match your request to your specifications: pocket, location, facilities, among other preferences. Our services cover everybody whose choices range from shops, one bedroom (simple or self-contained) to flats, duplexes, warehouses and office spaces anywhere in Nigeria. 
					We are officially registered in Nigeria with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) with the following details: RC. . . . . Our Head Office is located in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria <a href="{{pathFor route='contact'}}">(Click here for our contact details).</a> Flagstone board is constituted of three academic staff of University of Uyo and one law enforcement agent. That brings us to why Flagstone stands out in the property business crowd. Our services are rendered according to relevant constituted laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by which we run thorough background checks on property owners to ensure fraud-free transactions between parties.

					The idea of Flagstone came about in response to the futile search experienced by many on account of being busy at work, not finding the right location to satisfy such needs as security, constant water/electricity supply, good roads, good neighbourhood, adequate space, to mention a few. Far distance between our homes and places of work can have such adverse effects as low productivity and loss of revenue; it contributes to the wear and tear of your vehicles as well. If you are not on wheels, it becomes worse during rainy season to commute from home to work daily. Also, a good neighbourhood matters for parents whose children are still in their formative stages. Peer influence can make a mess of your parental role of bringing them up morally. 
					<br/><br/>
					These and many more reasons inspired the idea of Flagstone. Our unique style of addressing your property needs through the instrumentality of ICT has positioned us as the “Agent of Agents,” or if you like, the “Realtors of Realtors,” as our American friends across the ocean would call it. The limited coverage area of traditional estate agents has driven them into our supporting arms; hence we provide an infinite range of choices suitable for every client. Our added investigative component guarantees peace of mind for our clientele; and thus our FRAUD-PROOF mantra. 
					We invite you to embrace modernism.

					Thank you,
